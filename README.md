# LambtonTransit
LambtonTransit is android application created during Hackathon held at Lambton college. Primary focus of this application is to allow students to reserve their seat in college bus without standing in a queue. Uptill now students had to make a queue infront of pickup spot to get their seat in bus, this scenario even gets worst in winter. With help of this application, any student can select thier seat in any bus they want without having to stand in queue to enter in college bus.

To achieve this task, MySQL database is created to store information about Bus Timing and Students going in these buses.
To access this database from Android application, PHP web services are implemented. To make Network calls, third party library
OkHTTP is used.
